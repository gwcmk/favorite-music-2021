      <h1>My Favorite Songs of 2021</h1>

        One of the first moments that my friend Justin and I mutually felt that we could be good friends was over music.
        I was excitedly telling him about the rap music I liked and why I thought it was so good. To my amazement, even
        though he didn’t really listen to rap, he was genuinely interested. This was the first of many times over the
        years where we’ve bonded over the similar ways that we think about things.
      </p>
      <p>
        These similarities arose again during a tougher patch of time when we were both feeling a lot of anxiety about
        our lives. We both found solace in listening to music, particularly Mitski. When you’re feeling low, it can be
        so meaningful to have music that evokes what you’re feeling. I think our music tastes have changed in some ways
        since then, but we still both seek out music that really makes you feel something.
      </p>
      <p>
        This all came to mind as I was putting this list together because I noticed that many of the same artists from
        a couple years ago are topping my list. I worried whether I’ve returned to the same unpleasant emotional cycles
        of the past. But reflecting on the person I was in 2018/2019, so much has changed, and naturally, the feelings
        that these artists conjure have changed too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don’t relate to “Working for the Knife” because I have existential crises listening to it late at night.
        Instead, I relate to it because of my desires to feel more of a creative and personal connection to my work. And
        it would be ignorant of me to not acknowledge that these artists live their own lives and have changed a lot
        too. In the same way I previously found Earl’s raps about hopelessness and spiraling relatable, I now find
        “2010” to be inspirational. It’s awesome to see him be able to move on from all of the grief and trauma of his
        past and make music that’s so authentic to himself while also being undeniably masterful at his craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that realization, I’m very grateful for the progress I’ve made in the past few years. Justin likes to
        describe his life in phases, and in the spirit of that, I feel like we’re both moving toward new phases in our
        lives. Regardless of whatever life changes come next, it’s comforting to know that music can be a constant
        source of emotional connection with each other and ourselves through those times.
